/// `sessions scrolltop BASE [--overlay DIR] [--y Y] [--hold S]`: a tap on the status bar scrolls the frontmost list to
/// the top. Settings' list is dragged down, then tapped at the status bar's middle, released at once by default (a
/// trackpad's tap to click, which reached the guest as a lone TOUCH_ENDED until the digitizer kept its TOUCH_START
/// frame): each drag must change the picture and each tap bring the top's back. Whether the guest read the press before
/// the release came is a race, so a lost press failed about half the taps: --taps rounds (default 4) make a miss
/// near certain to show. A 5.x-7.x base needs --skip-setup or --overlay.
